Inspired by the 2008 WWF Japan Campaign [Population By Pixel](https://www.boredpanda.com/endagered-animals-pixels-extinction/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic), [PIECED](https://step129-2020.appspot.com) aims to visualize the declining populations of different species and highlight their vulnerability status. We hope to spread awareness to the public about these environmental issues and showcase just how close some species are to extinction. This project uses data from Wikipedia and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility API.
