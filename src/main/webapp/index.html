            Pieced aims to visualize the declining populations of different species and highlight their vulnerability status. 
            We hope to spread awareness to the public about these environmental issues and showcase just how close some species are to extinction.
            This project uses data from Wikipedia and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility API.
            <br> <br>
            The inspiration for Pieced came from a 2008 campaign 
            by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/endagered-animals-pixels-extinction/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic" class="font-weight-bolder">
            WWF Japan â€“ Population by Pixel</a> and the interactive exhibition <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/" class="font-weight-bolder">In Pieces</a>. 
            With Pieced, we aimed to bring the concept of visualizing animal species through their population to a larger scale, providing additional information about the species along the way.
