            Conservationists say that we are in the middle of the sixth mass extinction due to human activity in the last couple centuries. Wildlife reports have concluded the following things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.</li>
            <li>Populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have, on average, declined 60% between 1970 and 2014.</li>
            <li>Up to 1 million of the estimated 8 million plant and animal species on Earth are at risk of extinction — many of them within decades.</li>
            <li>Global biodiversity is being lost much faster than natural extinction due to changes in land use, unsustainable use of natural resources, invasive alien species, climate change and pollution among others.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>
        <p class="lead">
            Millions of species have already gone extinct and many more will continue to do so unless we make big steps towards sustainability.
            If this trend continues, our ecosystems’ ability to sustain the planet’s species and meet human needs will be threatened.

            The inspiration for Pieced came from a 2008 campaign 
            by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/endagered-animals-pixels-extinction/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic" class="font-weight-bolder">
            WWF Japan – Population by Pixel</a> and the interactive exhibition <a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/" class="font-weight-bolder">In Pieces</a>. 
            With Pieced, we aimed to bring the concept of visualizing animal species through their population to a larger scale, providing additional information about the species along the way.
